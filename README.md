# Send-Data-on-cloud-using-gsm-800c

In this project we will learn about IoT using GSM Module. We will use SIM900/800 GSM Module with Arduino and send the DHT11 Sensor data to Thingspeak Server.
Nowadays we use ESP8266 or ESP32 or any other wifi Modules to send any sensor data to the Internet wirelessly. Hence Wifi comes into action and thus we need Wifi Connection for wireless communication with any server. But the disadvantage of using Wifi is, it is not available everywhere. The wifi signal is limited to certain locations and to a certain range up to a few meters. For example, in order to use IoT Connectivity and to get data from the farmer’s fields, we can’t rely on Wifi due to unavailability. Similarly forest, river zone, mountains are the areas where wifi connection is not available.

So, GSM GPRS is the only alternative left as per the present scenario and current technology. GSM GPRS Module allows you to add location-tracking, voice, text, SMS, and data to your application. The big advantage of GSM/GPRS Connectivity is, it covers a wide area and signal/connectivity is available almost everywhere.




So in this project, we will learn about the Internet of Things using GSM GPRS Module, i.e Cellular IoT. We will take SIM800C as a reference GSM GPRS Module and Interface it with Arduino Board. We will sense the surrounding humidity and temperature using DHT11 Humidity/Temperature Sensor. The humidity & temperature data will be sent to Thingspeak server using AT Commands for GSM Module. ThingSpeak server is an open data platform and API for the Internet of Things that enables you to collect, store, analyze, visualize, and act on data from sensors. So let us learn all about GSM Module with Thingspeak & Arduino.

SIM800C GPRS/GSM Modem Shield for Arduino is provides you a way to use the GSM phone network to receive data from a remote location，and it is compatible with all boards which have the same form factor (and pin out) as a standard Arduino Board. This shield can also be applied to DIY phones for calling, receiving and sending messages, making GPS tracker or other applications like Smart home etc.SIM800C GPRS/GSM Shield delivers GSM/GPRS850/900/1800/1900MHz signals for Audio, SMS and GPRS Service. Also, it runs at low power consumption of about 0.6mA in sleep mode but acts compliant to GSM phase 2/2+: Class 4 (2 W @850/ 900 MHz), Class 1 (1 W @ 1800/1900MHz) with two-in-one headset jack.
What’s more, to make your project more flexible and efficient,we have prepared two different antennas for you. One is the traditional GPRS antenna which is more sensitive while another one is on-board antenna which is more compact and easy to install.
